        <p>Hello, MNFurs! This is your elections committee with an announcement to make. As you may or may not know, MNFurs is a volunteer-based 501c3 not-for-profit organization. What that means is that we not only have volunteers but also a board of directors to help things run smoothly within the group, and we will be starting the election process for two seats for board of directors.</p>
        <p>Starting on January 1, we will start accepting nominations for board members, so start thinking about if there is someone you believe would be a good fit for an MNFurs board position; otherwise you can nominate yourself as well.</p>
        <p>We will be using <a href="https://mnfurs.org">MNFurs website</a> to make full announcements throughout the whole process, but feel free to contact elections@mnfurs.org if you have any questions about things such as running for the board, how to vote in elections, or what is expected as a board member.</p>
